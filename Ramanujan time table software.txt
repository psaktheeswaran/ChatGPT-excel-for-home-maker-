In this schedule, the teachers who are covering for the absent teacher on a given day take an additional period to compensate for the absence. Once the absent teacher returns, they need to take extra classes to ensure that they still cover 7 periods per week. This schedule maintains the weekly distribution of subjects and periods while accommodating teacher leave.
